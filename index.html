    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="container About">
      <p class="p1 row rowAbout">Yumeko Jabami is the main protagonist of Kakegurui. She is a transfer student at Hyakkaou Private Academy and the classmate of Ryota Suzui and Mary Saotome. Yumeko's family is aligned with the family of Kirari
        Momobami who challenges her for Hyakkaou Private Academy.</p>
      <h5 class="p1 row rowAbout aboutHeader justify-content-center">PERSONALITY</h5>
      <p class="p1 row rowAbout">Yumeko is shown to be a very upbeat and charismatic character who consistently attracts the affection or interest people around her. Not only is she able to befriend those who previously disliked her, she is able to catch the attention of the entire student body. She does just that on her very first day of school and manages to continue doing so on nearly a daily basis. Every time she notices an opponent cheating in games, her button gets switched to a bloodthirsty side of her, usually seen when her eyes turn red and she frightens her opponents.</p>
      <p class="p1 row rowAbout">Though she is typically very friendly, she abstains from acting this way when she uses her perceptiveness to expose her classmates' cheating. She is capable of doing this even after only a couple of rounds of gambling, as she is easily able to decipher what strategies and tricks they are using to skew the game in their favor. While doing this, she may unabashedly condemn the other player and their ways, preferring honesty over politeness in such cases.</p>
      <p class="p1 row rowAbout">Despite the disadvantage she faces when others cheat, she does not concede. This is largely due to the fact that she does not seem to experience fear or anxiety from taking risks. In fact, it gives her a thrill. Because of this, she tends to take high-risk bets in gambles, even if she has nothing to rely on but luck. Though this can sometimes end in her loss, she is emotionally unaffected by the results; she simply uses her loss or gains a means to further indulge her gambling habit. She also wants to make her friends feel the same rush as she does. So while her pushing them into risky gambles might seem irresponsible, she actually means it well.</p>
      <p class="p1 row rowAbout">She seems to be fairly aware of her eccentricities and that her way of gambling doesn't follow normal conduct. As such she rejoices when people support her or encourage her, especially those close to her, greatly valuing their friendship, albeit in her own ways. Despite the obvious joy and pleasure gambling gives her, Yumeko rationally understands that her behavior is immoral and depraved; she has admitted that she feels absolutely no remorse for the people she has defeated and ruined in a gamble, feeling instead guilty for her inability to sympathize with her victims</p>
